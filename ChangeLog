ChangeLog:
3.0.2:  - New IPV4 allocations
3.0.1:	- Fixed an issue using public commands where ripecheck did not alert nick/channel when something went wrong.

3.0:    - Ripecheck is now using the namespace ::ripecheck
	- Fixed duplicate entry in iplist.txt
	- Fixed minor issue with .ripesettings
	- Fixed an issue with the parsing of iplist.txt that caused a few invalid entries
	  being loaded
	- Ripecheck should now detect private and reserved net ranges, ie RFC1918 addresses
	- Added last resort function that will lookup an ip in a static function. This function
	  is used when the whois record is incomplete so that a country can't be determined
	- Fixed a few minor return values
	- NEW! Added !ripeinfo <host> command, it will return a few lines of the whois record for the 
	  host via NOTICE to the nick who sent the query. !ripeinfo works in channel and through /msg
	  to the bot
	
2.6.1:  - Ripecheck will now correctly handle channel name in lower case
	
2.6: 	- Ignore rwhois referrals
	
2.5: 	- Major bug fixed, ripecheck did not follow 'ReferralServer' from whois.
	  This could result in innocent hosts being banned. Unfortunatly a 'Country'
          entry was available in Referral output, which of course ripecheck
          used. Ripecheck should now have a lot less false positives.
	
2.4:    - Updated ip delegation list
	- Fixed a minor bug in .testripecheck function that caused
          wrong number of arguments being sent to whois_connect
        - Added help page through the dcc console, see .help ripecheck
        - Added usage information for individual commands, see .help +ripetopdom
        - <+/->ripetopresolv now support regexp pattern matching
        - Now possible to change default console output channel, default 'd'
        - Added support for custom ban messages, includes keyword substitution 
          support like %domain%, %ripe%  and %nick%, see .help ripebanr
        - Better output format from .ripesettings
	
2.3:    - Updated ip delegation list. Fixed a typo.
        - Reindented the code.
	
2.2:    - Updated iplist.txt with netmask changes
	
2.1:    - Fixed a bug in .testripecheck. Forcing top domains to
          lower case.
	
2.0:    - I'm happy to announce that it's now possible to configure
          everything through the dcc console. Setting top domains and
          resolve domains per channel is also available now. Code
          added to prevent configuration loss, not fool
          proof though.
	
1.1:    - New option for top domain banning based on configured
          top domains. Added public !ripecheck <host> command.
	
1.0:    - http dependency removed. Now connecting directly over a
          socket to the whois server. Still looking for
          potential bugs. Now support all whois databases!
	
0.7:    - New dependency added, tcllib.
        - Ripecheck will now try to guess which whois database
          to use, it should now be a lot more accurate when banning.
          Whois databases supported now are:
          RIPE, APNIC, ARIN, AFRINIC, VERIO
	
0.6:    - New function to resolve some topdomains and then
          do a ripecheck. Topdomains like .com .info might
          match countries in your topdomain list.
          It's also possible to change timeout for the RIPE
          query, recommended setting is default 5 seconds.
          Saving a few cpu cycles by breaking loops when a match
          was found.
	
0.5:    - Added better error handling during the http query.
        - Added channel flags so it's possible to enable/disable
          ripecheck per channel.
	
0.4:    - Changed to using http package instead of sockets.
        - Added configuration option for ban time
	
0.2:    - First release (not public)
